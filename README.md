# noWarnForUnknownPacket

A simple mod to keep you logs clean(and not spamming you logs or crash you mmc after a long time)

This mod might get integrated into my fabric tweaker mod(like [LiteTweaker](https://github.com/CrazyHPi/LiteTweaker) for 1.20) soonâ„¢.

## Current Removed Warnings
- "Received packet for unknown scoreboard: {}"
- "Received passengers for unknown entity"
- "Block entity {} @ {} state {} invalid for ticking:"
